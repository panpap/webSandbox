y-cruncher, (y for gamma) is a number crunching program that can compute
various mathematical constants.

It was originally a small program specialized for computing the
Euler-Mascheroni Constant. (which uses gamma as its symbol, hence the name)
It has since gained the ability to compute other constants.
